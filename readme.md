# FizzBuzz Generator üçæüêùüìú

## Background

This repo is a simple FizzBuzz sequence generator. I created it to practice some common algorithms, HTML injection and basic repo creation.

## Introduction

[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a game. Participants sit in a circle. Going around the circle they take turns counting upwards from 1. Certain numbers are substituted with words; instead of multiples of 3 participants say "Fizz", and instead of mutliples of 5 participants say "Buzz". Numbers that are multiples of both 3 *and* 5 are replaced with the word "FizzBuzz". 

For example, counting from 1 to 20 would give the following sequence:

 *"1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz "*

 A common technical interview problem is the production of an algorithm to convert a sequence of numbers into a FizzBuzz string. This repo solves that problem using modular JavaScript. It also includes an unstyled HTML UI that allows the user to define the start and end of the numerical sequence, as well as the multiples which will be replaced with the terms fizz and buzz.

## Motivation

I undertook this project to practice some key skills:

- Common technical test problems (*FizzBuzz*)
- Modular JavaScript in browser-based applications
- Injecting HTML using JavaScript
- Repo creation

## Screenshot

<img src="assets/screenshot.png" width="90%" alt="Screenshot of the web app. It is all in unstyled HTML; white background, black Times New Roman text. Under the title 'FizzBuzz String Generator' the user is invited to input several values. These are the first number in the integer sequence, the final number in the integer sequence, the multiple for Fizz, and the multiple for Buzz. A 'Calculate FizzBuzz' button can then be clicked. The page then shows the text 'Your FizzBuzz Sequence', followed by a string of numbers and words which is the calculated FizzBuzz sequence. The values used in the example are as follows: First integer = 1. Final ineger = 50. Multiple for Fizz = 3. Multiple for Buzz = 5. The FizzBuzz Sequence: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, FizzBuzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, 37, 38, Fizz, Buzz, 41, Fizz, 43, 44, FizzBuzz, 46, 47, Fizz, 49, Buzz.">
